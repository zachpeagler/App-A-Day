# App A Day
 Hello, I'm Zach Peagler and I'm creating an app a day until I get hired as a data scientist.

## **DAY ONE - 10/11/2024**
For day one I created an R Shiny app that uses meteorite data taken from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/meteorite-landings). It features a map using Leaflet, a couple of histogram, and a data viewer, and is themed with bootstrap via the R package bslib. It is published on shinyapps.io [here](https://zachpeagler.shinyapps.io/01_meteorites).
