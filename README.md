# App A Day
 Hello, I'm Zach Peagler and I'm creating an app a day until I get hired as a data scientist.

## **DAY ONE - 10/12/2024**
For day one I created an R Shiny app that uses meteorite data taken from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/meteorite-landings). It features a map using Leaflet, a couple of histogram, and a data viewer, and is themed with bootstrap via the R package bslib. It is published on shinyapps.io [here](https://zachpeagler.shinyapps.io/01_meteorites).

For more information, see the day one [README](/01_meteorites/README.md).

## **DAY TWO - 10/13/2024**
For day two I created a distribution fitting app. (It's still in progress)

I used example data taken from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/supply-chain-greenhouse-gas-emission-factors-v1-3-by-naics-6)

## **DAY THREE - 10/14/2024**
For day three I created an interactive scatter plot app using the iris dataset included in R.
